\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\noindent  Will Smith was born on September 25th in 1968. He started his
acting career in 1990 in the TV series `The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'. He
has gained success as a recording artist as well s a producer in films.
Denzel Washington was born on December of 28th in 1954. He first started
in the theater while working in the student drama production. His debut
was in the TV series called ``Carbon Copy'' in 1981. He works as an
actor, film producer, director, and also a screenwriter. Will Smith has
earned 4 Golden Globe Awards and 2 Academy Award nominations and several
Grammy Awards. On the other hand, Denzel Washinton has received 2 Golden
Globe Awards, 2 Academy Awards, and as well as a Tony
Award.\vspace{0.25in} \noindent  As we can see, they are both well-known
actors with many Awards. It is not so easy to distinguish who is better
than the other. Asking a question on who is a better actor is inherently
subjective, it is an arbitrary measure. There will be no right or wrong,
in the end, it is just an opinion. The goal of this paper is to come up
with the metrics to compare these actors objectively rather than
subjectively. The data was scraped from the IMDb website. The research
takes fish in the pond approach. It compares movies of each actor from
the popular 50 movies of each year from 1980 to 2019. Will was in 19
movies and Denzel was in 19 movies. There was a total of 1,998 movies in
this popular 50 movie list.In order to compare monetarily variables, I
have adjusted all the dollar values to the year 2000. \vspace{0.25in}

\end{figure}

\newpage

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:boxplot} The one graphic visualizes the
ranking distribution of each actor in the pond. The pond has 1,998
movies. Right off the bat, we can see both actors rank above average.
The average rank will be about 1000. These two actors are both popular
fish in the pond. We can also see that Will Smith outranks Denzel
Washington in every monetary metrics, this could be affected by many
things. Can genres of movies be correlated to revenue? Wills' majority
movie genres are comedy(41.4\%), drama(39.6\%), action(27.0\%), and
adventure(14.4\%). The majority of Denzels' movie genres are
drama(70.5\%), crime(34.4\%), action(29.5\%), and thriller(21.3\%).
According to the the-numbers.com(Statista,2020), adventure genre makes
the highest box office revenue in North America, followed by action,
drama, and comedy. \vspace{0.25in}

\section{Research Question:Monetary and popularity comparison between Will and Denzel}
\label{sec:rq}

\subsection{Who is better in terms of revenue/profit?}
\label{sec:rq2}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:boxplot} shows Will dominates Denzel in
revenue and profit domestically and internationally. One interesting
thing to see is that despite Wills' clear dominance of U.S gross and U.S
profit distribution overlaps quite a bit. Wills' monetary success in
movies vary more in the U.S than internationally. Will might be popular
globally more than Denzel. The Table\ref{t.test} is a result of pooled
t-test on some of the variables between Will and Denzel. The null
hypothesis was set as Will smith has a higher mean than Denzel
Washington. The Variables of comparison were ratings, votes, budget,
profit in the U.S, and profit outside of the U.S. I have used a
significance level of 0.05. All of the results except the rating
variable shows the p-values smaller than 0.05. Thus, we cannot reject
our null hypothesis.\vspace{0.25in}

\subsection{Who is better in terms of popularity?}
\label{sec:rq2}

\noindent Popularity can be measured from the ratings, votes, and the
popular rank. The \ref{Table1} and \ref{Table2} shows summary statistics
of popularity for each of actors in popular 50 movies. Let's compare
average ratings, the average number of votes, and the average popular
rank. Denzel has an average rating of 7.3, an average number of 214792
votes, and an average popular rank of 24. Will has an average rating of
6.7, an average number of 335646 votes, and an average popular rank of
27. Will and Denzel both are at star-meter rank 500. However, will has
gone of 67, whereas Denzel has gone done 64 in his star-meter. Traffic
to the IMDB actor profile directly affects the star-meter of each
actor/actresses. Denzel has a better average rating about 9\% higher
than Will. Denzel also has a slightly high ranking than Will on the
popular movie list. However, Will receives about 120000 more votes on
average and had growing foot traffic to his actor page.\vspace{0.25in}

\subsection{Summary Statistics of Data}
\label{sec:data-summary}

\input{tables/denzel.table}
\input{tables/will.table}

\newpage

\subsection{Inferential analysis}
\label{sec:inference}

\input{tables/t_test}

\section{Key Findings}
\label{sec:findings}

\noindent Through analysis, some of the key differences were found. The
popular movies of Will Smith generated more cash on average than Denzel
Washington. Wills' Opening week revenues were about 209\% of Denzels'
opening week revenue, U.S gross was 193\% of Denzels' movies, world
gross was 253\% of Denzels' movies, international gross was 337\% of
Denzels' movies, U.S profit was 274\% of Denzels' movies, world profit
was 307\% of Denzels' movies, and international profit was 352\%
Denzels' movies. The popular movies of Wills' make about 2 to 3 times
more of Denzels`. Will smith particularly outperforms outside of the U.S
compared to Denzel.\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent Popularity comparison tells us that Denzel has about 9\%
higher ratings than Will. However, Will has about 56\% more votes than
Denzel. Also, the star-meter tells Denzel has been losing web traffic to
his actor page whereas Will has been gaining more web traffic to his
actor page.\vspace{0.25in}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent After comparing all the metrics, I found out Will Smiths'
movies generate much more profits and the fact that he has a strong
international gross makes it hard to beat. Bringing money into the U.S
is even better for the economy than domestic transactions. Besides that,
Wills' movies make 2 to 3 times more revenue than Denzels. He is a clear
winner for the first battle. For popularity comparison, I have used
ratings, the number of votes, popular rank, and the star-meter. Here,
Denzel had better metrics on his ratings than Will. The pooled-t-test
result on rating metric tells us, indeed Wills' true average ratings
will be lower than Denzels'. However, Will's average number of votes
were significantly higher, and the pooled-t-test verifies that. Well, so
far they were tied. Therefore, I have decided to use the star-metric
delta values to decide the final winner for the popular comparison.
Looking at the star-metric delta value, Will has an increasing delta
value of 67 and Denzel has a decreasing delta value of 64. According to
the IMDB website, star-meters can tell you about public awareness and/or
interest in the actor. This could mean Will has high public influence
lately. Thus, I have chosen Will as the winner for the popularly
metric.\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent In conclusion, Will Smith scored higher on both monetary
metrics and popularity metrics. The metrics for popularity comparison
could improve on its feature selection. Unfortunately, Denzel has lost
this battle. Keep in mind, this does not represent beyond each actors'
monetary and popularity success. This does not mean Denzel is a bad
actor nor his movies terrible. I certainly don't judge one's ability to
act by their monetary success nor public popularity. Maybe, this could
be the next research question for continuing discussion. \vspace{0.25in}
